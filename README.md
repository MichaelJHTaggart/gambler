# Kanon Gaming - Front-End Dev Test

I spent collectively about 8 hours on this project. Planning, and building.

This project is not complete, but some of the completed aspects:
## Wireframing & Component Planning

## Schema

## Backend Authentication
 Please see the following Post-man results

## Basic Front-end Template

Unfortunately I encountered challenges when building out the slot machine function in the backend. This took about 4 of the eight hours that were spent working on this project. Due to this incompletion I have commented out the userController.

Here is the complete .env: **Please note** this includes a Connection String to a live database that I own at Heroku:
