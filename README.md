# Kanon Gaming - Front-End Dev Test

I spent collectively about 8 hours on this project. Planning, and building.

This project is not complete, but some of the completed aspects:
## Basic Front-end Template
## Redux setup
## Wireframing & Component Planning

## Schema

## Backend Authentication
 Please see the results of the hashed & salted passwords after testing with postman

Unfortunately I encountered challenges when building out the slot machine function in the backend. This took about 4 of the eight hours that were spent working on this project. Due to this incompletion I have commented out the userController.
