# Kanon Gaming - Front-End Dev Test

I spent collectively about 15 hours on this project. Planning, and building. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability as a web developer, given criteria and able to build an application upon being given the criteria. I quite enjoyed building this, and learned SO MUCH throughout the build! I look forward to building more projects like this in the future.

## Functioning backend slot machine
The slot machine is completely handled on the backend of the application. Updating the amount of coins that are in the database. I have never built logic to a slot machine before, and it took a lot of planning to get the function to where it is now. I would like to improve the function to be even more efficient in the future.

## Redux holding state
The global state management is being used to hold the session of a user, and to hold the value of state throughout the length of the session cookie. 

## Authentication
Using bcrypt the passwords are hashed and salted. The users can log in to see their accounts information. They can logout if they are finished.

## Backend Authentication
 Please see the results of the hashed & salted passwords after testing with postman

Unfortunately I encountered challenges when building out the slot machine function in the backend. This took about 4 of the eight hours that were spent working on this project. Due to this incompletion I have commented out the userController.
